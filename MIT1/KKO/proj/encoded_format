First 4 bytes are the width of the image after decoding.
The next 4 bytes are the height of the image after decoding.

    I.e. if the original image is 512 pixels wide and 712 pixels tall,
    then the encoded file starts with the following bytes:
    "0x00 0x00 0x02 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x02 0xC8".

The following byte contains used compression methods.
The following definitions of individual bits rise from the LSb
to the MSb of this byte.
    bit0: Set if the pixel subtraction model was used. Unset otherwise.
    bit1: Set if encoded in horizontal direction. Unset if in vertical.
    bit2: Set if adaptive image scanning was used. Unset otherwise.
    bit3: RESERVED
    bit4: RESERVED
    bit5: RESERVED
    bit6: RESERVED
    bit7: RESERVED
