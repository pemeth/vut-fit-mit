// Idea:
// 1 )	A todo manager. Requests will have a form of operations over the todos,
// 	such as add, remove, change, etc. These requests will be handled
// 	in a chain, such that only one link of the chain will complete the
// 	request or none at all. There is the possibility of user defined
// 	extensions, for example marking a task as completed, but not
// 	removing it, etc.
