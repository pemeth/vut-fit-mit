A repository for my master's degree program at VUT FIT.

The repo structure consists of directories named MITn, where 'n'
represents the year of the program (e.g. MIT1 is the first two
semesters). Inside these directories are further directories named
according to the individual classes.

Classes:
  MIT1:
    KRY - Projects in C/C++ and Python aimed at cryptography.
    PRL - Projects in C++ aimed at parallelization.
    KKO - Project in C++ aimed at compression algorithms.
    WAP - Projects in JavaScript.
    MSP - Mathematical statistics.
    FLP - Project in Haskell aimed at formal grammars.
    TIN - Theoretical computer science.
    BIO - No published project.

  MIT2:
    BZA - Project in C aimed at implementating some of the Platypus side-channel attacks.
    GUX - Project in C with the GTK toolkit.
    AVS - Projects in C++ aimed at writing vectorized and effective code.
    FLP - Project in Haskell aimed at formal grammars. [class retaken]
    PDS - Project in Python aimed at network traffic analysis.
